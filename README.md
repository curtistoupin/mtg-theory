# mtg-theory
MTG theory is an attempt to introduce mathematical rigor to various concepts in Magic: The Gathering such as card advantage, mana advantage, tempo advantage, the concept of a stack, and so on. The hope is that this will be a stepping stone which will help the avid player develop heuristics against which to make real-time decisions in games, or more ambitiously the beginnings of an improved AI capable of playing MTG at a high level when connected with a rules engine such as xMage.

This book is a work in progress as are the mathematical concepts contained therein.
